It is important to provide logs to us. A single line error log does not provide much information. If it is possible, please
enable debug log by setting log_level and provide the full logs to us. If you have any logging plugin enabled, please
provide the related request logs to us as well.
Here is our KB article about enabling debug log on different platforms.

https://support.konghq.com/support/s/article/how-to-enable-debug-log

Problem with OIDC and JWT signer
On top of plugin configuration and debug log, we need a sample JWT token (For example, id_token,
access_token from your IDP). This is to help us understand how your token is signed, what claims are on the token
to debug further.

Problem observed on browsers
If you observe the issue on your browser, you may want to generate and provide a HAR file to us.
To generate HAR file, please check this article. You can also analyse the HAR file with HAR Analyzer.

Version Support Policy
Please make sure the Kong version you are running is currently within the support window to avoid any surprises.
Specifically, if you are at the end of full support (in sunset phase) Kong will not provide patches for software covered
by this sunset period.
For more detail, please check our support policy here.

Do's and Don'ts
Please do NOT use screenshot for logs and configurations. Please save your logs and configurations to different files and attach
them to the case. We highly encourage you to provide reproduce steps to us. This will significantly reduce the time for debugging
and finding a solution for you.`,
